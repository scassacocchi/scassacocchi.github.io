## Project Management Experience  

**Erasmus Exchange Programme Coordinator (2014-16)**  
As Department Coordinator at Bilkent University from 2014 to 2016, I was responsible for organising both student and faculty exchanges with partner universities in the UK, France, Spain, Greece, Germany and the Netherlands, and establishing new partnership agreements with institutions such as Eszterházy Károly College in Hungary.  

**Drug Action Projects (2003-04)**  
As Drug Action Team Manager, I was responsible for running the multi-agency partnership and coordinating drug-related services across the borough. Statutory partners, all with their own objectives and targets, included Berkshire NHS (National Health Service) Trust, Reading Borough Council, Thames Valley Police, Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service, and the National Probation Service. The role involved considerable project management. Projects I personally managed included the setting-up of a needle exchange scheme and dropbox to keep drug paraphernalia off the streets and minimise health risks for users, and the establishment of the Reading Users Group to ensure that drug users had input into decisions around the provision of treatment services.  

**Community Safety Projects (2000-02)**  
As Community Safety Projects Officer for Lambeth, I sat on six multi-agency working groups (Domestic Violence, Street Crime, Anti-Social Behaviour, Burglary, Youth Offending, Alcohol and Drug-related Crime.) I was also responsible for administering the Community Safety Projects Fund on behalf of the multi-agency Community Safety Partnership. This meant advertising the Fund to community groups and voluntary organisations, soliciting bids for funding, evaluating bids and then supporting and monitoring the selected projects to ensure they met milestones, stayed on budget and were completed on schedule and in compliance with the relevant regulations. While some projects had budgets in the hundreds of thousands (e.g. town centre CCTV provision), others were very small-scale and run by local community organisations, such as a summer football coaching programme for BAME youth in Brixton, and a domestic violence awareness programme. These projects often required considerable administrative and advisory support, which I provided.
