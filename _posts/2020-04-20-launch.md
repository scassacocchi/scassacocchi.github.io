This is my first attempt at a blog post on this my new website - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and by [GitHub] (http://github.com). I can use Markdown to author my posts, apparently, which means it is easy to insert _italics_ and **bold** type, and even _**bold italics**_. What excitement.
